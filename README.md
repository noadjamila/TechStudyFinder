# TechStudyFinder

**TechStudyFinder** is a web application designed to help young people discover Informatics study programs that align with their **interests, hobbies, and personality**.

Many young people never consider studying Informatics because they assume it’s only about programming or math. This project aims to change that by showing how diverse and creative IT can be and how it connects to things people already care about.

## Project Overview

The app helps users explore how their personal interests can relate to Informatics and related study programs.  
It’s meant to **inspire** and **guide**, not test technical skills.

**Planned user flow:**
1. Users enter their interests, hobbies, or personal values.
2. The system suggests Informatics study programs that fit those inputs.

> The project is currently in the **concept and prototyping phase**.  
> The final architecture and algorithm will be determined as the system evolves.
