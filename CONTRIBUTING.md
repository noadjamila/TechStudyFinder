# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. The following guidelines describe the preferred workflow and expectations for contributions to this project.

## Code of conduct
All contributors are expected to follow the project Code of Conduct. See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for details.

## How to contribute
You can contribute in these ways:
- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps and environment details.
- Propose features with motivation, use cases, and suggested design.
- Submit bug fixes, improvements, or new features via pull requests.
- Improve documentation, tests, and examples.
- Help with issue triage and reviews.

## Reporting bugs
When opening an issue, include:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots.
- Environment details such as OS, runtime, and dependency versions.

## Proposing changes or features
When proposing a new feature:
- Describe the problem and why the change is needed.
- Provide a proposed design or API when possible.
- Mention alternatives considered and trade offs.
- Link related issues or discussions.

## Development workflow
- Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- Create a topic branch with a descriptive name, for example:
    - fix/short-description
    - feat/short-description
    - docs/update-readme
- Run tests and linters locally before committing.
- Keep changes focused and atomic.
- Update or add tests and documentation for your changes.
- Push your branch and open a pull request against the repository default branch (typically main).

## Commit messages
Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Start with a short summary of about 50 characters.
- Separate summary from body with a blank line.
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how.
- Reference related issue numbers, for example: Fixes #123

## Pull request process
- Link the relevant issue or provide necessary context in the PR description.
- Describe the changes and the reasoning behind them.
- Ensure all tests and CI checks pass.
- Be responsive to review feedback. Maintain a constructive tone.
- Maintainters may request changes, and may rebase or squash commits when merging.

## Tests and style
- Add or update tests to cover new behavior and regressions.
- Follow the project style guide and run linters and formatters before submitting.
- Keep test suites fast and deterministic when possible.

## Security
To report security vulnerabilities, consult SECURITY.md if present. If no security contact is documented, open a confidential issue or contact a project maintainer directly rather than disclosing sensitive details publicly.

## Licensing and contribution rights
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be included under the project license. If the project requires a Contributor License Agreement or a Developer Certificate of Origin, follow the repository instructions.

## Questions
If you are unsure how to proceed, open an issue to discuss the proposed change before implementing it.

Thank you for helping improve this project.
